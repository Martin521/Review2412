  - complications
    - no preprocessor => late pragma processing
    - streaming => ruminating regurgitating diagnosticsLogger
    - #line => show pars.fs/fsy, range.fs
  - #nowarn in parser not longer possible
- show WarnScopes.fsi
- walk through commit 1 diff
- (if time) walk through WarnScopes.fs ==> rename TempData to LexbufData
- walk through the other commits
  - 3: ==> fsi.fs:3695: use tcConfigB.diagnosticsOptions, no need to thread diagnosticsOptions through the function call
  - 5: (start with SyntaxTrivia.fs)
